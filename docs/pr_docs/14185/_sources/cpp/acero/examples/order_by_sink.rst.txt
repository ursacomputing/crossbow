=============
Order by sink
=============

``order_by_sink`` operation is an extension to the ``sink`` operation. 
This operation provides the ability to guarantee the ordering of the 
stream by providing the :class:`arrow::compute::OrderBySinkNodeOptions`. 
Here the :class:`arrow::compute::SortOptions` are provided to define which columns 
are used for sorting and whether to sort by ascending or descending values.

.. note:: This node is a "pipeline breaker" and will fully materialize the dataset in memory.
          In the future, spillover mechanisms will be added which should alleviate this 
          constraint.
