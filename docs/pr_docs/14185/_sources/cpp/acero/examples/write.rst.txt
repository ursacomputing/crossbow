=====
Write
=====

The ``write`` node saves query results as a dataset of files in a
format like Parquet, Feather, CSV, etc. using the :doc:`./dataset`
functionality in Arrow. The write options are provided via the
:class:`arrow::dataset::WriteNodeOptions` which in turn contains
:class:`arrow::dataset::FileSystemDatasetWriteOptions`.
:class:`arrow::dataset::FileSystemDatasetWriteOptions` provides
control over the written dataset, including options like the output
directory, file naming scheme, and so on.

Example:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../cpp/examples/arrow/execution_plan_documentation_examples.cc
  :language: cpp
  :start-after: (Doc section: Write Example)
  :end-before: (Doc section: Write Example)
