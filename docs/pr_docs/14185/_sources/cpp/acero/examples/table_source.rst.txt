============
Table Source
============

In the previous example, :ref:`source node <stream_execution_source_docs>`, a source node
was used to input the data.  But when developing an application, if the data is already in memory
as a table, it is much easier, and more performant to use :class:`arrow::compute::TableSourceNodeOptions`.
Here the input data can be passed as a ``std::shared_ptr<arrow::Table>`` along with a ``max_batch_size``. 
The ``max_batch_size`` is to break up large record batches so that they can be processed in parallel.
It is important to note that the table batches will not get merged to form larger batches when the source
table has a smaller batch size.
