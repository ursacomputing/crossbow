Scan
====

``scan`` is an operation used to load and process datasets.  It should be preferred over the
more generic ``source`` node when your input is a dataset.  The behavior is defined using 
:class:`arrow::dataset::ScanNodeOptions`.  More information on datasets and the various
scan options can be found in :doc:`../../dataset`.

This node is capable of applying pushdown filters to the file readers which reduce
the amount of data that needs to be read.  This means you may supply the same
filter expression to the scan node that you also supply to the FilterNode because
the filtering is done in two different places.

Example:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../cpp/examples/arrow/execution_plan_documentation_examples.cc
  :language: cpp
  :start-after: (Doc section: Scan Example)
  :end-before: (Doc section: Scan Example)
  :linenos:
